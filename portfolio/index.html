                Here's a fun easter egg: I also built https://thesmellofburntflesh.com as an hommage to the weird side of
                the internet. Sites like http://batheinmymilk.com are unnerving and absurdist, and I wanted to do something similar.
                I reached out to a writer buddy of mine and we cooked that site up in a weekend. Now you know!
