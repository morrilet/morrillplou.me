# For the site

* Look into removing the 'post' tag requirement for posts... putting the file in /posts/ should be enough.
* Look into [markdown-it-attrs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-attrs) for inline .md styling. This could be handy for things like images.
* ~~Desaturate blog header images.~~
* ~~Blog content formatting.~~
* Gallery displays for images
* Tag / category search (header)
* Post creation / update dates (header)
* ~~Syntax highlghting~~
* ~~Progress bar under blog header~~
* ~~Make blog header sticky~~
