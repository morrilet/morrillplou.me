**Sammy and the Orb** is a puzzle platformer set in an abandoned laboratory. You play as Sammy, a small, set-upon robot who discovers an orb that can manipulate time and bring in objects from other dimensions. Puzzle your way through five unique levels and help Sammy fulfill his mighty destiny!

## Gameplay

You can create three types of platforms for traversing the world.

* The **Standard** platform is just your run-of-the-mill solid platform.
* The **Conveyor** platform moves things left or right, depending on how it was placed.
* The **Gravity** platform bounces anything it touches.
You can place up to **three platforms in a single life**, and you can have up to **nine active platforms at any given time**. Platforms are incorporeal when first placed, but will **solidify after you die**.

Placing platforms is contextual, meaning the platform you place depends on what you're doing. 

* If you're in the air you'll place a **Standard** platform.
* If you're moving left / right you'll place a left / right **Conveyor** platform.
* If you're standing still you'll place a **Gravity** platform.

## Controls

* **A / D** - move left and right
* **W / Space** - jump
* **Shift + Space** - place a platform (see Gameplay)
* **Hold R** - respawn
* **Hold Shift + R** - clear platforms
* **1-4** - Emote
