**Dive as deep as you can**, but keep an eye on your oxygen line - the local wildlife can get a little cheeky.

## Gameplay

Descend as far as you can without letting anything cut your oxygen line. Turtles will stun you, but fish and spikes will break your line if they touch it, so watch out! You can slow your descent by wall-sliding or jumping off of platforms, should you need to.

## Controls

* **W / D** or **Left / Right Arrow** to move left and right.
* **Space** to jump.
