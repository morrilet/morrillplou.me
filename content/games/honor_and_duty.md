## About the Game

Honor and Duty: D-Day is an online PVP shooter set during the D-Day landing in World War II. Players compete in Team Death Match, Domination, and Free For All matches or in a separate Battle Royale 
mode. Online games feature 16 v 16 matches (32 player FFA/BR) in a fast paced environment Players can drive tanks and jeeps across large maps in search of the enemy. Players rank up to unlock access 
to all 4 player classes which each have different abilities.

Players can choose their class, character, and weapons from 4 classes, 4 player characters, and a number of weapons including machine guns, rifles, shotguns, a rocket launcher, and a flame thrower.

## My Involvement 

This was the second of two games I worked on for [Strange Games Studios](https://www.strangegamesstudios.com/). My involvement on this project was as a freelance programmer, 
but it was a pretty small studio so I wound up doing working on both the codebase as well as a handful of simple visual assets and effects. Tasks I worked on for Honor and Duty: D-Day 
include dynamic ambient effects (e.g. planes dogfighting overhead, ambient AA cannons), particle systems, weapon handling animations, game logic, and some basic multiplayer code. 
Originally releasing on Playstation VR, this title eventually made it's way to Steam and still sees fairly regular online play.

I feel that I learned a lot from my time on this project, and it's super fun to look at it today and see some of my old work still kicking around.
