**Find your feathered friends in nine unique levels featuring four unique duckling types!**

You play as a mama duck trying to get her ducklings (and some stragglers) into the cool waters of the park fountain. They'll follow you wherever you go, but be warned: they're highly distractible!

## Gameplay

Collect ducklings around each level and bring them to the fountain to score points. Levels end when you run out of time or collect every available duckling. You're given a star rating based on how many points you get, but you're always allowed to go to the next level!

**Normal Ducklings** will follow you wherever you go. They're worth 1 point.

**Ugly Ducklings** will push their way to the front of the line, and when they can't go any further they'll scatter every duckling behind them. If you can put up with their antics they'll turn into beautiful swans worth 3 points.

**Copycat Ducklings** behave just like normal ducklings but they can't be pushed aside by ugly ducklings. If they're behind an ugly duckling when they enter the fountain they'll become an elegant red swan, worth 1 point for every duckling in the chain.

**Dogs** are really just ducklings at heart. They need to see a few other ducklings following you, but once they do they'll come join in on the fun. Dogs are worth 10 points.

**Breadcrumbs** and **Squirrels** are very enticing! They will cause your ducklings to break away from you.
