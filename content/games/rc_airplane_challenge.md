excerpt: A multiplayer VR title about flying (and sometimes fighting) RC airplanes. This was the first game I worked on for Strange Games Studios.

## About the Game

Fly model airplanes in this arcade styled flight sim. Fly by yourself offline or with up to 32 other players in online gameplay.

Single player features the following 5 game modes:
* Free Flight - fly casually around the map while practicing your RC skills as well as looking for hidden items.
* Bomb Drop - Destroy as many targets as you can in this timed mode.
* Rings - Try to fly through as many rings as you can with each new ring becoming increasingly harder to hit.
* Balloon Pop - Pop as many balloons as you can in this timed mode.
* Time Trial - Complete the course as quick as you can in this race against time.

## My Involvement 

RC Airplane Challenge is the first of two games I worked on with [Strange Games Studios](https://www.strangegamesstudios.com/), and it was my first experience
working with Playstation VR titles. I was a freelance programmer but I did a lot of miscellaneous work on this project ranging from visual effects to 
player controller code. My involvement was before the multiplayer aspect of the game was announced, but I worked on all of the singleplayer game modes. One 
of my favourite problems to solve was that of randomized racetracks. I can't say for certain whether that system is still in place or not, but I wrote a 
bit of code to generate aerial racetracks out of bezier curves (and display them in Unity) that I'm still pretty happy with. After a while of working on this 
project I was pulled over to [Honor and Duty: D-Day](/portfolio/games/honor-and-duty-d-day/), the main project the studio was working on at the time.
