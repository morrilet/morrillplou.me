excerpt: A time-trial physics game about a space-faring delivery company made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 45.

**Captain!** We're running on fumes, here! We're out of fuel and we haven't even reached the pickup point yet. If the backup power for the tractor beam holds, we may be able to complete our deliveries, but we'd be endangering the lives of everyone on this vessel...

Is whatever's in those boxes really worth *all* that?

**About**

StarLink Xpress is a time-trial physics game about a space-faring delivery company made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 45. Use your tractor beam to zip and glide past asteroids and make all of your deliveries on time!

**Objective**

Pick up packages at stations and deliver them to homes. Don't let the time run out, and don't take too many hits.

**Controls**
* Left Mouse - Fire tractor beam
* R - Restart the current level
* Esc - Exit to main menu
