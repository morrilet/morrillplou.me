excerpt: A puzzle game about rolling dice. Built with an 80's office aesthetic for GMTK Jam 2022.
---

Dice to meet you is a cute, casual puzzle game that challenges you to think critically about every turn of the dice. 
With twelve unique levels to play through there's never been a better time to gather around the fern and show your coworkers your sensitive side.

Built in 48 hours for GMTK Jam 2022.

## The Rules

* Win by getting to the end of the level with the correct side (as shown by the level exit) facing up.
* Coworkers will mirror your movements as long as you have the same side facing up as they do.
* Some buttons require you to have the correct face pointing up. They will show a number of dots on their face.
* Red buttons need to be held down continuously to function, but blue buttons do not.
* All levels are unlocked in the "Cubicle Select" if you get stuck!

## Controls

* "WASD" to move the die.
* Reset the level with "R" or the button in the bottom right corner.
* Return to the main menu with "ESC" or the button in the bottom right corner.
