excerpt: A local multiplayer shooter about working together to fight foes that straddle the great divide. Made for Brackeys Jam 2021.1.
---

**Gunny and Sprite have been drinking buddies for as long as either of their booze-addled brains can remember, so when Sprite keeled over and didn't immediately ascend to the great beyond they knew what they had to do: raid the depths of Heck for a half-corporeal beer. A tale as old as time - one last hurrah and Sprite can finally rest in peace.**

*Spooks & Shells* was made in just about a week for Brackey's Jam 2021.1. Due to a scheduling snafu the deadline didn't quite shake out, but we're counting it as a win. The gameplay can be described as a hectic top-down shoot-'em-up with characters straddling either end of the great divide.

Note: **Gamepad required.**

## The Rules

* Bullets are either corporeal or incorporeal.
* Any bullets that pass through the ghost player's spectral rift switch between being corporeal or incorporeal.
* Ghosts can only be hurt by ghost bullets.
* Fleshies can only be hurt by regular bullets.
* Players share a health total.
* Friendly fire is on.

## Gunner Controls

* W/A/S/D to move.
* Mouse to aim.
* Left mouse button (hold) to shoot.

## Ghost Controls

* Left analog stick to move.
* Right analog stick to look.
* X (hold) to activate spectral rift.
