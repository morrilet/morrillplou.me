Meth Horse loves his meth. That's implied, of course. But that's not really his problem. That's his therapist's problem. No, Meth Horse's problem is his meth pregnancy. For you see, seahorses give birth to thousands of children at once, and he has to put every one of them through university! Well, only if he recognizes them as legitimate, that is. So this is how it must be. Meth Horse must avoid contacting his children at all costs. Meth is already expensive enough on its own. He is determined not to pay for their tuition.

Made for Ludum Dare 37.


**Controls:**

'WASD' or Arrow Keys to move.


**Gameplay:**

Pressing forward will birth a meth baby. This is how Meth Horse propels himself, as he has only a tiny flipper and cannot properly swim on his own. Poor Meth Horse.
