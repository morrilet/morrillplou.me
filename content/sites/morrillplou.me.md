excerpt: A portfolio website built with the JAMStack in mind.
---

A portfolio site build using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). By the time I started building my new portfolio site I had seen enough
of the dynamic content world to know that's not what I wanted (or needed). My site is ultimately pretty simple - just some portfolio pages and 
blog posts. There's a lot of content here, but nothing that requires dynamic data or a database connection. Instead, I opted to get some practice
using the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/). I really like this approach, and I think for small sites like this it's my preferred way
of working. I edit content in markdown files and the site is generated at build-time so I only serve plain HTML / CSS. As an added bonus
I'm able to hook everything up to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) so form management, server maintenance, and continuous integration are all 
out of sight.
