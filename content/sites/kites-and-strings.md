excerpt: A small podcast site built with Svelte and Netlify CMS.
---

A podcast website I built to help out a family member and get some practice using Svelte. Part of the process for this involved integrating
(and debugging) the podcast API provided by Buzzsprout. I also made use of [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to give full control
of the content over to the folks running the site day-to-day.

## Tools Used

* Svelte
* Netlify CMS
* Javascript
* HTML / CSS

## Credits

* Ethan Morrill-Ploum
    * Design & code.
