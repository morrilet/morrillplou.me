# Inroduction

I’ve been working on a little two-week-then-release type game called Cart Fight (no name is perfect, it’s a work in progress). Cart Fight is a local multiplayer (yeah, no online multiplayer. Unet documentation is lacking) party game about beating down the other shoppers and filling your cart. Today I finished a two day long push to get a local multiplayer lobby set up, and I wanted to talk a bit about how I did it and the system I used. Who knows, maybe someone out there will find it useful.

Before I get into the details, the rules of the internet clearly state that the finished product must come first. Behold!
