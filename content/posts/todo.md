# For the site

* ~~Look into removing the 'post' tag requirement for posts... putting the file in /posts/ should be enough.~~
* Look into [markdown-it-attrs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-attrs) for inline .md styling. This could be handy for things like images.
* ~~Desaturate blog header images.~~
* ~~Blog content formatting.~~
* Gallery displays for images
* Tag / category search (header)
* ~~Post creation / update dates (header)~~ [Manual update entry for now :(](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/443)
* ~~Syntax highlghting~~
* ~~Progress bar under blog header~~
* ~~Make blog header sticky~~
* ~~Remove gradient from blog post title.~~
* ~~Media queries for gutter size~~
* ~~Blog post preview text from the home page~~
* Image captions
* ~~[Typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/) for the type-stack.~~ Not gonna work. Went with a traditional stack.
* Ignore directory for drafts
* ~~Product pages (games, sites, etc.)~~
* ~~Overview sections~~
* Download fonts and link them using @font-face so they actually render properly on the site.
* Table styling in blog posts.
* Related tags to show portfolio / blog entries on each other's pages if related. (ie. MemErr Postmortem linked in MemErr game page.)
* Contact pop-up.
* Split games into jam / long-form / professional
* Banner image variable anchoring (SYTYCS would be best to anchor to top, Mothership best to keep centered, etc.)
* Fix typography differences in lists vs paragraphs
* Center images in thumbnails.
* Add dates to nav entries where available
* ~~Lightbox for screenshots in game pages.~~
* ~~Optional thumbnail image that isn't the banner image.~~
* ~~Youtube embeds in markdown (would like to embed Line devlog in game page.)~~
* Fix thumbnail jitter
