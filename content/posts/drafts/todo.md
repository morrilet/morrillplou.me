# For the site

* ~~Look into removing the 'post' tag requirement for posts... putting the file in /posts/ should be enough.~~
* ~~Look into [markdown-it-attrs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-attrs) for inline .md styling. This could be handy for things like images.~~ -> works, but not what we needed. Used markdown-it-modify-token to inject classes for images.
* ~~Desaturate blog header images.~~
* ~~Blog content formatting.~~
* ~~Gallery displays for images~~
* Tag / category search (header)
* ~~Post creation / update dates (header)~~ [Manual update entry for now :(](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/443)
* ~~Syntax highlghting~~
* ~~Progress bar under blog header~~
* ~~Make blog header sticky~~
* ~~Remove gradient from blog post title.~~
* ~~Media queries for gutter size~~
* ~~Blog post preview text from the home page~~
* ~~Image captions - why only working on single images? Did we hide this from the gallery view for some reason?~~
* ~~[Typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/) for the type-stack.~~ Not gonna work. Went with a traditional stack.
* ~~Ignore directory for drafts~~
* ~~Product pages (games, sites, etc.)~~
* ~~Overview sections~~
* Download fonts and link them using @font-face so they actually render properly on the site.
* ~~Table styling in blog posts.~~
* Related tags to show portfolio / blog entries on each other's pages if related. (ie. MemErr Postmortem linked in MemErr game page.)
* ~~Contact pop-up.~~ -> Went with a form.
* ~~Split games into jam / long-form / professional~~ -> Done via tags for now.
* ~~Banner image variable anchoring (SYTYCS would be best to anchor to top, Mothership best to keep centered, etc.)~~
* ~~Fix typography differences in lists vs paragraphs~~
* ~~Center images in thumbnails.~~
* Add dates to nav entries where available
* ~~Lightbox for screenshots in game pages.~~
* ~~Optional thumbnail image that isn't the banner image.~~
* ~~Youtube embeds in markdown (would like to embed Line devlog in game page.)~~
* ~~Fix thumbnail jitter~~
* ~~Remove game link (itchio, gamejolt icon) styling on click.~~
* ~~Fix long blog title overflow on mobile devices~~
* ~~Alt text for HD:DDay images~~
* ~~Footer space~~
* Add 404 page.
