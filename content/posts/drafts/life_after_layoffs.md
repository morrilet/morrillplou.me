# So, I got Laid Off

It's an interesting time in tech, so I'm told. You've probably been hearing about industry-wide layoffs, or maybe you've been impacted yourself. I had my first dance with the devil in late April of this year, when I was laid off from a dream job, and I have some thoughts about it.

# A Disclaimer

First and foremost, I want to say that I'm not here to complain about the layoff. Ultimately, I understand that business is business and I'm not upset about that. I want to share my experience so in case you find yourself or someone you know in a similar situation. Everyone handles these things differently, so please don't take what I say here as anything more than my personal experience. If you've been laid off and can't relate, that's totally normal.

So, those first few moments were shocking. I'd be lying if I said I got much done in the first week. What I *did* do was sprint to send in as many job applications as I could, but that only lasted a couple days before my body caught up to my legs and I slowed to a crawl. This is where I started feeling pretty down. Without that sense of urgency I didn't send any applications for about a week, and my optimism that the ones I sent at the start of the process would bear fruit slowly faded. Then I got a rejection letter.

# Rejection Letters are a Good Thing(?)

Okay, bear with me. Rejection letters suck, but I find them weirdly comforting. Getting a rejection letter means someone actually saw my application, and that feeling of screaming into the void fades a little bit. Job searching can be incredibly isolating, but hearing back (even if it was bad news) was comforting.

A note to hiring teams: send more rejection letters. It's way more work and it closes a door, but your candidates will appreciate it. I've also applied to places specifically because their listing mentions that they'll respond within some amount of time, so who knows, maybe you'll get more applicants.

# Share Resources

I believe the industry is undergoing a massive re-shuffle. Lots of companies are laying off, sure, but lots are hiring as well. Those of us unfortunate enough to get laid off are stuck in the churn, but we're likely not without a shore nearby. Keep an eye out for positions that might be a fit for those around you, and keep a list to share with those around you. Better yet, organize a group and set up a shared spreadsheet.

TODO:
* Staying in contact with people helped
* Resource sharing is great, but sometimes comes with an expectation and having space helps
    * Share resources in a format that gives folks space - i.e. a spreadsheet or shared doc

Notes:
* Try to avoid actionable advice. Talk about what helped and how you felt, but don't give "tips".
    * The share resources section might violate this.
